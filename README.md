# ESP32-IoT-Temperature-Humidity-Monitoring-with-ThingSpeak-and-OLED-Display
This project uses two ESP32 boards to create a wireless temperature and humidity monitoring system. One ESP32 reads data from a DHT11 sensor and uploads it to ThingSpeak using HTTP. The second ESP32 retrieves this data from ThingSpeak and displays it on a 0.96" OLED screen using the Adafruit SSD1306 library. Ideal for IoT demonstrations, wireless sensor networks, and remote environmental monitoring applications.
